# Textile Fabric Loss Calculation & Management System

# Overview
Developed an industrial automation and management platform for real-time tracking of fabric utilization and loss across textile production cycles. The system integrated inventory analytics, process monitoring, and automated loss computation, achieving a 20% reduction in material waste and enhancing operational efficiency.

# Framework
Domains: Industrial Automation, Software Engineering
Frameworks/Tools: Python, SQL, Flask/Django, Inventory Management Systems, REST APIs
Goal: Automate tracking and minimize fabric wastage during production
Affiliation: National Textile University

# Scope
 Designed and deployed an end-to-end fabric inventory management system.
 Automated loss tracking through real-time data ingestion from production lines.
 Implemented data-driven loss prediction and alerts for quality assurance.
 Delivered custom dashboards for inventory and wastage visualization.

 # Methodology
 1. Data Acquisition & Integration

 Integrated with existing ERP and production line data sources (roll weight, length, batch logs).
 Standardized data streams via RESTful APIs for uniform processing.

 2. Fabric Loss Calculation Engine

 Built a rule-based computation engine to calculate:
  [text{Loss (%)} = \frac{\text{Input Fabric} - \text{Output Fabric}}{\text{Input Fabric}} \times 100]
 Incorporated machine-level calibration for measurement precision.

 3. Inventory Management Module

 Automated real-time stock updates and batch traceability.
 Implemented predictive reorder alerts based on consumption trends.

 4. Visualization & Reporting

 Developed a web dashboard with KPI metrics (loss %, production rate, cost impact).
 Enabled daily, weekly, and monthly analytics reports with export functionality.

# Results
| Metric             | Before | After Implementation | Improvement |
| Fabric Waste       | 12.5%  | 10.0%            | ↓ 20%       |
| Reporting Delay    | 48 hrs | <5 mins          | ↓ 99%       |
| Inventory Accuracy | 85%    | 97%              | +12%        |

# Key Outcomes:
 Reduced overall material wastage by 20%.
 Enhanced inventory transparency and production traceability.
 Minimized manual record-keeping errors through full automation.
